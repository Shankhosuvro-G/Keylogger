# Keylogger
This repository contains an educational project demonstrating a Python-based keylogger that utilizes the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm to secure captured data.
Keystroke Logging: The keylogger captures and records all keystrokes.
Active Window Logging: Along with keystrokes, the keylogger also records the active window title, providing context to the captured keystrokes.
Timestamp: Each recorded keystroke is accompanied by a timestamp, providing a chronological context to the logged data.
Fernet Encryption: All captured data is encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm, ensuring the security of the logged data.
Educational Purpose
This project is created purely for educational purposes. It serves as a practical example to understand the workings of keyloggers, the application of encryption techniques, and the importance of data security.
